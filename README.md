OMOP-2-OPMI

OMOP-2-OPMI is an ontological representation of the OMOP CDM elements and the relations among these elements. Its development supports ontology-based OMOP data standardization, integration, and advanced analysis. 

The project started when we were devleoping our OPMI ontology and its usages. Mr. Long Tran has joined the OMOP-2-OPMI development since 2021. 

OMOP-2-OPMI has also been used for different applications.
